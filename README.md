# Windows Kernel Assembly ReverseEngineering Notes

In my job, I need to find some "secret" by reverse engineering to windows kernel.

There are lots of notes and difficult to manage them. So I tried push them to github.

They are usually reversed from Win10 / WinServer 2019 / WinServer 2022 / Win11.

Different windows version could have different ASM code and structures.

This repo is just a note repo, NO GUARANTEE for anything.

If you are intetrested about this , discussion is welcome.
