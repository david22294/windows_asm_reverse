# Windows Asm ReverseEngineering Notes

In my job, I need to find some "secret" by reverse engineering to windows kernel.

There are lots of notes and difficult to manage them.

So I tried push them to github.



They are just notes, NO GUARANTEE for anything.

If you are intetrested about this , discussion is welcome.
